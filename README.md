## Lessons Learned

This project is all about customer segmentaion and classification on the basis of age, subscription status, package usage by the customer for a Telecom Company. Used advance machine learning and visualisation libraries like; Sci-Kit learn, Scipy, Numpy, Pandas etc.

Throughout this project I have learned about preprocessing of data and feature learning, model building through different kind of classification algorithm; like:Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree etc.
